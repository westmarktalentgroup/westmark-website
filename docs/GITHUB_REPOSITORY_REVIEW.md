## üéØ **RECOMMENDED ACTIONS**

### **Priority 1: Clean Up Old PRs**
```bash
# Close stuck PRs
PRs=(2 3 4 6)
for pr in "${PRs[@]}"; do
  curl -X PATCH \
    -H "Authorization: token $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
    "https://api.github.com/repos/westmarktalentgroup/westmark-website/pulls/$pr" \
    -d '{"state": "closed"}'
done
```

### **Priority 2: Delete Old Deployment Branches**
```bash
# Delete all old deployment branches
for branch in deploy-20251022-* deploy-20251023-* deploy-20251026-113954 deploy-20251026-114209 deploy-horizontal-scroll-fix deploy-modern-system; do
  git push origin --delete $branch 2>/dev/null || true
done
```

### **Priority 3: Sync Local Main**
```bash
# Pull latest changes
git checkout main
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
```

### **Priority 4: Verify GitHub Settings**
- ‚úÖ Branch protection rules: Active
- ‚úÖ Repository rulesets: Active
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions workflows: 2 active
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old branches need cleanup
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Old PRs need closing

## ‚úÖ **WHAT'S WORKING WELL**

1. **Branch Protection**: Active and working
2. **Recent Deployments**: PR #10 successfully merged
3. **Workflows**: Both workflows active and updated
4. **Security**: Protection rules enforced
5. **Automation**: Deploy script working

## üîß **ACTIONABLE ITEMS**

### **Immediate (Do Now)**
1. Close abandoned PRs (#2, #3, #4, #6)
2. Delete old deployment branches
3. Sync local main with remote
4. Clean up local tracking

### **Ongoing (Do Regularly)**
1. Auto-delete deployment branches after merge (implement in deploy script)
2. Monitor PR status
3. Clean up old branches weekly
4. Review GitHub Actions workflow runs

## üéØ **RECOMMENDATION**

Create a cleanup script that:
1. Closes abandoned PRs older than 24 hours
2. Deletes merged deployment branches
3. Keeps only active branches
4. Maintains clean repository state

‚úÖ **COMPLETED OCTOBER 26, 2025**

All recommendations have been implemented:

1. ‚úÖ **Closed Abandoned PRs**: PRs #2, #3, #4, #6 all closed
2. ‚úÖ **Verified Branch Cleanup**: Old branches already deleted
3. ‚úÖ **Synced Local/Remote**: Main branch is now in sync
4. ‚úÖ **Added Auto-Cleanup**: Deploy script now auto-cleans old branches
5. ‚úÖ **Created Cleanup Script**: `scripts/github-cleanup.sh` for manual cleanup

## üéâ **REPOSITORY STATUS: CLEAN AND HEALTHY**
