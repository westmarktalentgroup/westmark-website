# 🚨 PRODUCTION FILES - DO NOT EDIT DIRECTLY

## ⚠️ **THESE ARE PRODUCTION FILES**

**❌ NEVER EDIT THESE FILES DIRECTLY**
**✅ EDIT IN `development/` DIRECTORY INSTEAD**

## 🔄 **Correct Workflow:**
1. **Edit files in `development/` directory**
2. **Test your changes locally**
3. **Run `./deploy.sh`** to copy to production
4. **Commit and push** to GitHub

## 📁 **What These Files Are:**
- **Auto-generated** from development directory
- **Managed by deployment script** (`deploy.sh`)
- **Served by GitHub Pages** as the live website
- **Backed up automatically** before each deployment

## 🚨 **If You Need to Make Changes:**
1. **Go to `development/` directory**
2. **Make your changes there**
3. **Run `./deploy.sh`** to deploy
4. **Never edit these files directly**
